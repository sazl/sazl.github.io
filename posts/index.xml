      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been interested in reading about the lives of the Roman Emperors and their various intrigues. I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble keeping things in memory so I&amp;rsquo;ve started charting out the lines of succession.
Below is an example starting from Antonius Pius&amp;rsquo; rule as part of the Nerva-Antonine Dynasty and ending on the last ruler of the Severan Dynasty.

      <description>â€œThe peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.</description>

      <title>The State of Python Profiling</title>

      <guid>https://example.org/posts/the-state-of-python-profiling/</guid>
      <description>There are no good python profiling tools. Here is what I consider necessary from a profiler:
 Cross platform Profiling of live applications Ability to generate profiler dumps (preferably gprof compatible) Call tree profiling Line-level profiling  The built-in python profilers cProfile and profile don&amp;rsquo;t meet 1, 2, and 5. 3rd party alternatives also fall short.
Pyflame A great live profiler:
 low overhead. live profiling of processes. generates profiler dumps, convertible to gprof and svg.</description>

      <title>Tools for Software Architecture</title>

      <description>Some thoughts on architecture and understanding big systems. If you can&amp;rsquo;t fit it all in your head, you don&amp;rsquo;t get it. We need tools to capture specifications and running systems more succinctly.
I&amp;rsquo;d like diagnostic and instrumentation tools that capture data like a modern factory&amp;rsquo;s control systems. I&amp;rsquo;d love to be able to drill down from a high level overview of the system to the operations of a single component, such as looking at a particular Kafka&amp;rsquo;s consumer group size.</description>

      <title>Tachyons Is Nice for Templates</title>

      <description>Tachyons is Nice Tachyons.io is great for templates and prototypes. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t write a full landing page in it or anything that&amp;rsquo;s not dynamically generated. Why? because it&amp;rsquo;s got the same problems as css class composition in HTML, there&amp;rsquo;s no way to group css classes you import.
An example:
&amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;aside fl w-80 ma1 pa2 lh-copy&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;aside-heading lh-title&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Technologies&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul class=&amp;#34;list pl0 pt3&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; It gets hard to stack css classes into the html tag.</description>

      <description>Picking a technology, either:
 Pick a well-maintained, robust, and boring solution that gets you 90% of the way there. Pick a new solution that scratches your exact itch. You must be willing to maintain it yourself.  There is a trade-off between how specialized a tool is at solving your problem and how much work is involved in maintaining it over time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting back into J after reading this twitter thread:
https://twitter.com/digitalbeard/status/987775955220430848
I first learned of J around 10 years ago. I remember reading &amp;ldquo;Easy J&amp;rdquo; and being amazed. Here was something so alien from everything I thought I knew about programming languages. The verbs, adverbs, and conjunctions were so cohesive, everything seemed to flow effortlessly. Writing J programs was somewhat akin to poetry, something explained better by Alan J. Perlis.</description>

      <description>The deployment of Kubernetes has become a little easier using the kubeadm tool. The tools are still in alpha and the guide is still not as thorough as I would have hoped.
Installing Flannel as a Pod Network Once you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the first two steps, you should have a working master node. To add additional child nodes you must install a pod network. I chose to install Flannel but there are other options available.</description>
