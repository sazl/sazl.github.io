What do you do in hard times? When you're not religious and have no spiritual inclinations.
I mostly read biographies of people I admire.
Something about their struggle, whether it was ultimately successful, fills me with a sense of purpose.
Although my problems may be miniscule compared to theirs, I can learn something from it all.

Some people I always revisit:

- Eugene V. Debs
- Emma Goldman
