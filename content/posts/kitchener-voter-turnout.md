I'm saddened by the abysmal turnout in the KW municipal elections.
Less than a third of eligible voters turned out (28%).

[Unfortunately, low voter turnout is a general trend for Canada.](https://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/Details/society/voter-turnout.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1)
What can be done to fix this? It's obvious that people are apathetic. There's no enthusiasm to vote. It doesn't help that there isn't much information on each candidate's views. I scoured The Record and [waterlooregionvotes](https://waterlooregionvotes.com) to find any concrete platform for each candidate.
