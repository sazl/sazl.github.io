- Subnautica:

Amazing environment that's varied and fun to explore. Really good sense of immersion and isolation, the ocean feels vast and terrifying.
Great survival mechanics but I toned down the food as I found it a grind to keep having to forage.
The story is compelling and there's enough mystery to keep you playing. I was able to easily log 20+ hours
without many distractions. The base building is fun and keeps the replay value high. It's also great collecting
vehicles and upgrading their capabilities, nice goals to keep you playing.

- Into the Breach:

Very nice turn based mechanics. Easy to pick up but there's a lot of depth to the way the mechs movement and shooting
abilities interact. Great environments with differing effects and multipliers, keeps things interesting as you progress.
The perma death aspect is very punishing but at least 1 commander from your unit continues on to the next timeline.
There's a variety of upgrades that can be collected with points, keeps the replay value high.
