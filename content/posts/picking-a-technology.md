Picking a technology, either:

1. Pick a well-maintained, robust, and boring solution that gets you 90% of the way there.
2. Pick a new solution that scratches your exact itch. You must be willing to maintain it yourself.

There is a trade-off between how specialized a tool is at solving your problem and how much work is involved in maintaining it over time.
