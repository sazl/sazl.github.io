I subscribed to a music service recently.
I've been listening to my old favorites.
I'm growing my "IDM" playlist pretty fast.
IDM: What I call bands like Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Autechre etc.

These services have a recommendation feature (usually disguised as a radio).
I've been recommended some nice songs so far.
That's how I got to learn about [Î¼-Ziq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Paradinas).
His songs slowly crept into my saved playlist.
