I've been using JXA at work to automate installations and upgrades of our desktop software.
Typical of Apple APIs, it's terribly documented and its level of support isn't clear.

Besides the initial announcements and a smattering of content on the AppleScript pages, most information
on JXA has to be pieced together from random forums and StackOverflow.

This was also my experience when dealing with trying to sign 3rd party apps on OSX. Apple's signing tools
and documentation are equally terrible. Incomprehensible error codes are the norm. The entire
process is trial and error, you randomly assemble a working solution by throwing stuff at the wall
and seeing what sticks. I don't want to think about how many hours I wasted deciphering spctl's output.
