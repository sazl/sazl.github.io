      <description>I&#39;ve recently been interested in reading about the lives of the Roman Emperors and their various intrigues. I&#39;m having trouble keeping things in memory so I&#39;ve started charting out the lines of succession.
Below is an example starting from Antonius Pius&amp;rsquo; rule as part of the Nerva-Antonine Dynasty and ending on the last ruler of the Severan Dynasty.
I&#39;d love to automate this process but I&#39;m having trouble tracking down resources.</description>
